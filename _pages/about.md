Hi, I'm **Dan Wade**. I'm a tech, privacy, and IP lawyer in New York, NY. I'm licensed to practice in Massachusetts and Connecticut.[^1]

In my day job, I am a litigator for [Fish & Richardson,](https://www.fr.com) where I have represented clients around the US in patent, copyright, and trade secrets cases in federal courts, at the PTAB, and at the ITC. I've worked with clients in software, consumer electronics, semiconductor, aerospace, and biomedical spaces. I also counsel clients on privacy and data security, including best practices, compliance, and breach mitigation. I am a Certified Information Privacy Professional [(CIPP/US),](https://iapp.org/certify/cippus/) with a special focus on the Connecticut Data Privacy Act. 

I used to work at the [BU/MIT Technology Law Clinic,](https://sites.bu.edu/techlaw/) where I dove into all kinds of off-the-wall tech and privacy issues, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act's application to security research, export control under EAR and ITAR, the various sectoral privacy laws in the US, and more. Before that, I worked as a software engineer at MathWorks and an electrical engineer at what used to be called UTC Aerospace Systems.

I have a robust pro bono practice, representing clients in partnership with [Northeast Legal Aid,](https://www.northeastlegalaid.org/) [ACLU Massachusetts,](https://www.aclum.org/) and [the PAIR Project.](https://www.pairproject.org/) Northeast Legal Aid named me their [Pro Bono Champion for 2024.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/northeast-legal-aid-inc_volunteer-with-nla-activity-7285394084913950720-EB4g?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABTMjpIB2oiX4-3agpqh8JRXAkrtxQ9QP5Q)

In my free time, I [write and play music,](https://soundcloud.com/danielharanmusic) lift a lot of weights, and play hockey and softball.
