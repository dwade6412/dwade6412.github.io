## An associate's ~~panic~~ reminder

Trial: stressful, sleep-depriving, exhilarating, and then some. How do you not suck at it?

### Step 1: don't drop the ball early

A colleague I really trust put it this way: trial is a crucible that jams a prybar into your weaknesses and tries to split you open. Brutal as that is, I agree with him: high-level trials with complicated issues (hello, patent litigation) demand a ton from you all at the same time, and your weakest points come to the fore. It isn't insurmountable, but it *does* require you to have a plan for addressing your shortcomings so that you don't let yourself and the team down. 

An example: I finished up a trial earlier this year (we won on noninfringement and invalidity, which rocked) where I was the only associate (would not recommend being the only associate) and handled some of everything: drafting demonstratives and examinations, prepping experts for direct and cross, collecting materials for nightly disclosures, reviewing and objecting to opposing counsel's nightly disclosures[^1], researching and drafting issues for dispute briefs and the jury instructions, and more. To get that all done, you have to be ready to change contexts at the drop of a hat, and you need to keep track of what tasks are on your plate, how far along you are in finishing them, and what order they need to get done in. You do so much with so little.

Part of making this work means figuring out how to step outside of yourself (just a little bit) and subvert the things that keep you from focusing on the right things at the right time. 

But a different part of making this work involves seeing ahead of the bend in the tracks to do now what could be done later (but worse and under a much tighter time crunch).

A different colleague I really trust had this to say: one of the hardest things to do, but probably one of the best things to do, is to take 30-60 minutes a day and work on the massive thing you know is coming down the line. Expert reports are due in 3 months? Start talking to the expert *now* and get bits and pieces done. Why? Two reasons. First, it becomes much less likely that you will be stuck up against the deadline, crunching late at night and destroying brain cells to get major parts of the case done (expert reports, dispositive motions, etc.). Second, by getting (at the *very* least) the skeleton of major, case-spanning things done, you force yourself to put together the whole picture of the case, which informs everything else you do.

Disclosure: **I suck at this!** This is easily the thing I am worst at. The number one piece of critical feedback I get is that while the work I do is good, it's often after the deadline I set for it. This does not feel good! As someone who takes it really personally when I let friends, family, and colleagues down, I feel like a total dick when it happens. Thus I am saying this as much to myself as anyone. 

Thus, the ultimate conclusion: it's trite and reductive to say "preparation" is important but it is. But what's important is a different kind of preparation than what it seems like at first glance. You have to know what your weaknesses are and know how to 

An example of how this plays out: I can never remember when the nightly disclosures are and what things have to go when. So, for my last trial, I did two things: (1) I made a quick-reference guide for the timings of the disclosures and how far ahead of time they had to be done, and (2) I took the (ever-evolving) plan and timetable that the team put together for trial, and then mapped out the disclosure tasks onto regular sheets of paper so that I could *see* (and not just think of) what had to get done when. Why? Because I suck at getting my tasks done on time if I don't get my list of tasks out of my head and onto something else (paper, a text file, etc.).
