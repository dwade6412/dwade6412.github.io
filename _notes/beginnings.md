### What are we doing here?

I've been struggling with a kind of writer's block/intellectual malaise for a little while. As part of ~~casting about in a panic~~ trying to unpack what's happening, I found the concept of a [digital garden.](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) I think the ideas that speak the most to me about it are the (1) focus on process over results, (2) concept of working with the garage door up, and (3) forcing myself to try to think in a non-linear way, what with the backlinking and clouds of notes. So I figured I would start my own garden. Welcome.

### What am I thinking about?

- How do I build a mental gym?
- Politics
    - The death of empathy in American law and society
    - Law is politics is law is politics
- Bad science
- What happened to my curiosity?
- How do I make this site look more [like this?](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)
- [DHW WORKING]

### What am I trying to learn?

- Statistics and statistical thinking (again, because it didn't really take the first time)
- Piano
- Exploring ideas in public (scary!)
- Building a writing practice
